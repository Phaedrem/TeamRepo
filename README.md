# TeamRepo
Collaborative Git Workflow Practice

Setup:
1. Form a Team: Pair up with another student. You will work together
throughout this assignment.
2. Create a Remote Repository: One team member (Member A) should create
a new repository on GitHub, named TeamRepo. Make sure to iniEalize it
with a README.
3. Add Collaborator: Member A should add the other team member (Member
B) as a collaborator. This can be done in the repository seMngs under
'Manage access'.

Tasks:
1. Clone the Repository:
• Both members should clone TeamRepo to their local machines using
git clone <repository-url>.
2. Create Development Branches:
• Each member should create their own development branch locally.
Use your names or initials to name the branches, like dev-A and dev-
B.
• Push these branches to the remote repository.
3. Simultaneous Development:
• Each member works on their own branch, making changes,
committing, and pushing to their respective branches.
• Create or edit files, ensuring that both members make some
significant changes.
4. Pull Requests:
• Once a set of changes is ready, each member should create a pull
request on GitHub to merge their branch into the main branch.
• Review each other's pull requests and discuss any conflicts or required
changes.
5. Merge Pull Requests:
• After agreeing on the changes and resolving any conflicts, merge the
pull requests.
6. Synchronize Local Repositories:
• Both members should synchronize their local repositories with the
remote main branch by pulling the latest changes.
Submission guide: submit a screenshot of the remote github repository branch info
and a screenshot of the remote github repository commit history
